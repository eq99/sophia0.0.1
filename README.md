# sophia0.0.1
project sophia version 0.0.1

This is a new project behind sophiadb,
that project is failed because of the bad design of api.

- api name is a mess
- the function name is a mess
- the api changes so quick

This is only a skelon project, any fucntion is not implement.

- only defines the folder structure
- only function name, doc is write.
